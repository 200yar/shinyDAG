# shinyDAG

shinyDAG is a web application that uses R and Latex to create and assesses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This program is built upon the previous work of dagR for evaluating DAGs and Latex for producing publication quality DAG images. The web-based application can be accessed here  [https://gerkelab.shinyapps.io/shinyDAG/](https://gerkelab.shinyapps.io/shinyDAG/).

## Citing shinyDAG

Coming soon!

## Example of shinyDAG

The following DAG was reproduced from "A structural approach to selection bias" by Hernan, Hernandez-Diaz, and Robins (Figure 6A) using the shinyDAG web app.

## Accessing shinyDAG 

Simply access [https://gerkelab.shinyapps.io/shinyDAG/](https://gerkelab.shinyapps.io/shinyDAG/) through the web browser of your choosing!

## Using shinyDAG 


The web based tool allows users to build their DAG based completely on user inputs. The resulting DAG aesthetics can then be altered to meet the users preferences. After selecting for the exposure and outcome, all open and closed paths are displayed as well as minimal adjustment sets and conditional independencies.
